ðŸŸ§ Team 360 / The Revolution's 2023 Robot Code ðŸŸ¦

This is Team 360's code used for the 2023 Charged Up FRC season. We won the Judges' Award at Clackamas and went to Worlds for the first time since 2018! Our code is a little messy, so look in the 'Arm' branch for the most updated version.

Besides using swerve for the first time, our main innovations this year were field oriented turret and the Setpoint system (which moved the turret, arm, and claw to preset scoring positions).

Good luck to everyone for the 2024 and future seasons,
AdiÃ³s! Bye y'all!! See ya later!!! ðŸ‘‹!!!!
